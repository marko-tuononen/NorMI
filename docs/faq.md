# Frequently Asked Questions

### Should I upgrade the package?
You can check out the CHANGELOG.md to see what changed.

### How can I interpret the results?
Check out our publication for two detailed examples.

### Is it possible to install the CLI only?
Partially, yes. If you do not want to screw up your current Python environment
there are multiples possibilities. Either create a virtual environment on your
own via `conda` or `venv`, or you can simply use
[pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/).

### Feature X is missing
If you believe that a crucial functionality/method is missing, feel free to
[open an issue](https://github.com/moldyn/normalized-mi/issues) and describe
the missing functionality and why it should be added. Alternatively, you can
implement it yourself and create a PR to add it to this package, see
[contributing guide](../contributing).


### I found a bug. What to do next?
